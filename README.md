# My first [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)
___
I never really participated in dev culture, such as advent of code or hackathons. I don't really know why.
Probably my imposter syndrome telling me that I am not good enough to participate at such a "cultural" event.
But this year I decided to ignore that bastard and at least start. 

I will add a .md file to each task and share my thoughts. Mostly for me, but maybe someone else takes interest.

# Language of my choice
___
I earn my bread mostly with PHP, but sometimes I am allowed to touch Go code. And I like Go code. At least most of the
time. I think my knowledge of Go is pretty good, but again my imposter syndrome tells me that I suck. And maybe I do!
But the only way to improve is by building stuff, so I decided that I will use Go for this year's AOC!
